My name is homebrewman. I am going to do Phd in Tokyo soon, so this blog is created for
- Improving my English and Japanese writing skills

- Share my beautiful moments when I am in Tokyo

<!-- My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family 

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

What else do you need to know about me? Just leave a message by making issue on github `:heart_eyes:`

### My bio

To be honest, I will post it later `:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:`

### My history

Well, I save all my histories to my hard drive. Unfortunately, I forget my password to access them `:sob:`. I will post it right after I find my password to access `:cry:`.
