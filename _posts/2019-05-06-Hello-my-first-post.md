## A credit

This is my first post of this blog. Many thanks to [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) for create an awesome blog-theme on github.


### Use LaTex to write equations

I found [LaTex/Mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) is wildly used to write equations on the website, such as [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).

For example, use `$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$` to write

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

Use `k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}` to write

$$k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}$$

Thank zjuwhw for your tutorial.
